# Chronic_disease_risk_prediction_ML
The primary objective of this system is to provide highly accurate chronic disease risk prediction through innovative data processing and natural language input. By empowering users to assess their disease risk swiftly and proactively, it aims to promote early intervention and better healthcare outcomes.Chronic diseases represent a significant global health challenge, and early prediction and intervention are essential for effective management and prevention. This abstract explores the development of a Chronic Disease Risk Prediction system utilizing Machine Learning (ML) techniques, integrated with a user-friendly interface powered by Gradio.

The goal of this system is to empower individuals to assess their risk of chronic diseases by simply inputting their symptoms and relevant health information. Leveraging ML models trained on extensive health data, the system can provide predictive insights into potential chronic disease risks.
